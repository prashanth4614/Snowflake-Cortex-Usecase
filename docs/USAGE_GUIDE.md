## Query Examples

### Single Tool Queries

#### Policy Questions (Faq Search)
```
✅ "What is the refund policy?"
✅ "How do I return a product?"
✅ "What are the shipping options?"
✅ "What is the warranty policy?"
```

#### Data Questions (Sales Analyst)

✅ "What are the top selling products?"
✅ "How many refunds were processed?" (asking for count, not policy)
```

### Compound Queries (Both Tools)

These questions require information from BOTH tools:

```
✅ "What is the refund policy and how many refunds were issued?"
   → Faq Search: gets refund policy
   → Sales Analyst: counts refunds in database

✅ "What are the shipping options and what is our average shipping cost?"
   → Faq Search: gets shipping policy
   → Sales Analyst: calculates average cost

✅ "Explain the return process and show me the return statistics for last quarter"
   → Faq Search: gets return process
   → Sales Analyst: queries return data
```

## Using Debug Mode

### Enabling Debug Mode
