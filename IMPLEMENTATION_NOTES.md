# Multi-Tool Orchestration Fix - Implementation Notes

## Problem Summary
The Streamlit application was failing to properly combine results from both Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst when users asked compound questions requiring both tools.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Weak Prompt Engineering**: The original `response_instruction` was not explicit enough about when and how to use each tool, causing the agent to try answering data questions using only document search results.

2. **Response Processing Issues**: The `process_sse_response` function was overwriting SQL results instead of accumulating them, and lacked visibility into which tools were actually being called.

3. **No Debugging Visibility**: Users and developers had no way to see which tools were being invoked, making it difficult to diagnose orchestration failures.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Response Instruction (Lines 56-85)

**What Changed:**
- Replaced the brief, single-sentence instruction with a comprehensive, structured prompt
- Added explicit rules about data source separation
- Included execution strategy with numbered steps
- Provided concrete examples of compound queries
- Added strong language ("MUST", "CRITICAL", "CANNOT") to prevent tool misuse

**Why It Works:**
- The agent now has a clear mental model of tool capabilities and limitations
- Examples demonstrate the expected behavior for compound queries
- The structured format makes it easier for the LLM to parse and follow the instructions

### 2. Improved Response Processing (Lines 95-156)

**What Changed:**
- Added `tools_called` list to track which tools are invoked
- Added tool_use event detection to log tool invocations
- Changed SQL accumulation strategy to keep the last non-empty SQL query
- Added conditional debug messages based on debug_mode flag
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

**Why It Works:**
- Developers can now see exactly which tools are being called
- Users get real-time feedback about what's happening
- Better tracking of tool results prevents data loss

### 3. Debug Mode Toggle (Lines 193-207)

**What Changed:**
- Added sidebar with debug mode checkbox (enabled by default)
- Added visual tool reference in sidebar
- Stored debug_mode in session state
- Made all debug messages conditional on the flag

**Why It Works:**
- Users can toggle verbose logging on/off as needed
- Debug mode helps diagnose orchestration issues in real-time
- Clean production experience when debug mode is off

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Single Tool - Faq Search
**Query:** "What is the refund policy?"
**Expected:** 
- Should call ONLY "Faq Search"
- Should display policy information from PDF
- Should show citations

### Test Case 2: Single Tool - Sales Analyst
**Query:** "How many orders were placed?"
**Expected:**
- Should call ONLY "Sales Analyst"
- Should generate and display SQL query
- Should show results in dataframe

### Test Case 3: Compound Query (Both Tools)
**Query:** "What is the refund policy and how many orders were placed?"
**Expected:**
- Should call BOTH "Faq Search" AND "Sales Analyst"
- Should display policy information with citations
- Should generate and display SQL query
- Should show results in dataframe
- Debug mode should show both tools were used

### Test Case 4: Data Query About Refunds
**Query:** "How many refunds were processed?"
**Expected:**
- Should call ONLY "Sales Analyst" (this is data, not policy)
- Should generate SQL querying the REFUNDS table
- Should NOT call "Faq Search"

## Monitoring Points

When debug mode is enabled, watch for:

1. **üîß Calling tool:** messages - confirms which tools are invoked
2. **‚úÖ SQL query generated** message - confirms Sales Analyst produced SQL
3. **üìä Tools used in this response** summary - shows all tools called
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è No tools were called** warning - indicates orchestration failure

## Known Limitations

1. **LLM Behavior Variability**: Even with improved prompts, LLM behavior can vary. The agent may occasionally still fail to call both tools.

2. **Response Instruction Length**: The instruction is now quite long. If you hit token limits, you may need to condense it.

3. **SQL Overwriting**: If multiple SQL queries are generated, only the last one is kept. This is usually correct but could be an issue in edge cases.

## Future Improvements

1. **Multi-SQL Support**: Modify the response processor to handle multiple SQL queries if needed
2. **Tool Call Validation**: Add a post-processing check to verify expected tools were called
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry queries that fail to call the expected tools
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Add thumbs up/down to track when orchestration works correctly

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, you can revert to simpler instructions by replacing lines 56-85 with:

```python
"response_instruction": "Use 'Faq Search' for policy questions and 'Sales Analyst' for data questions. For compound queries, call both tools and combine results."
```

And remove the debug tracking by reverting `process_sse_response` to its original form.
